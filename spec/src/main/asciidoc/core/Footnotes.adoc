footnote:a10218[Earlier releases of this specification distinguished a seventh role, that of the persistence provider. The role of the persistence provider is independent of that of the EJB specification, which assumes that a Java Persistence implementation may be pluggable. See <<a9851>>.]
footnote:a10219[More literally, references are passed by value in the JVM: an argument variable of primitive type holds a value of that primitive type; an argument variable of a reference type hold a reference to the object. See <<a9876>>.]   
footnote:a10220[This may not apply to stateless session beans; see <<a1065>>.]
footnote:a10221[Note that the EJB 3.x session bean business interface is not an `EJBObject`. It is not valid to pass a reference to the remote business interface through a bean’s remote component interface.]
footnote:a10222[It is part of the logic of an application designed using stateful session beans to designate a method that causes the removal of the stateful session (and thus allows for the reclamation of resources used by the session bean). This example assumes that the `finishShopping` method is such a `Remove` method. See <<a921>> for further discussion.]
footnote:a10223[If the business interface is a remote business interface that extends `java.rmi.Remote`, the `java.rmi.RemoteException` is received instead.]
footnote:a10225[This may not apply to stateless session beans; see <<a1065>>.]
footnote:a10226[This may not apply to stateless session beans; see <<a1065>>.]
footnote:a10227[Use of `javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow` is not needed when the EJBContext `lookup` method is used to look up the remote home interface.]
footnote:a10228[Note that this requirement does not apply to the `EntityManager` and `EntityManagerFactory` objects.]
footnote:a10229[The container is not permitted to destroy a stateful session bean instance because it does not meet these requirements.]
footnote:a10230[Note that the Java Serialization protocol dynamically determines whether or not an object is serializable. This means that it is possible to serialize an object of a serializable subclass of a non-serializable declared field type.]
footnote:a10231[Component contract and client view of entity beans are described in the EJB Optional Features document <<a9890>>.]
footnote:a10232[Except for the `javax.mail.Session` resource manager connection factory.]
footnote:a10234[This is to allow the container to swap out an instance’s state through techniques other than the Java Serialization protocol. For example, the container’s Java Virtual Machine implementation may use a block of memory to keep the instance’s variables, and the container swaps the whole memory block to the disk instead of performing Java Serialization on the instance.]
footnote:a10235[Any initialization methods defined for the bean by means of the `init-method` deployment descriptor element apply in addition to those defined by means of annotations.]   
footnote:a10236[Any remove methods defined for the bean by means of the `remove-method` deployment descriptor element apply in addition to those defined by means of annotations.]   
footnote:a10237[The concurrency management type `CONTAINER` may be specified for stateful session beans, but doing so has no impact on the semantics of concurrency management for such beans.]
footnote:a10238[The `javax.ejb.ConcurrentAccessException` is a subclass of the `javax.ejb.EJBException`. If the business interface is a remote business interface that extends `java.rmi.Remote`, the client will receive the `java.rmi.RemoteException` instead.]
footnote:a10239[Note that the existence of global JNDI names for the local and no-interface client views does not imply that cross-application access to those entries is required. See <<a242>> for more details.]
footnote:a10240[If an `AroundConstruct` lifecycle callback interceptor is associated with the stateful session bean, the container follows the rules for the `AroundConstruct` interceptors defined in the _Interceptors_ specification <<a9887>>.]
footnote:a10241[If a stateful session bean lifecycle callback interceptor method is invoked in the scope of a transaction, session synchronization callbacks for such transactions are not called on the bean instance — see section <<a2750>>.]
footnote:a10242[Note that if the Java Persistence API is used, the persistence provider will use the beforeCompletion notification to automatically flush any updates to the container-managed persistence context to the database. See <<a9851>>.]
footnote:a10243[If the business interface is a remote business interface that extends `java.rmi.Remote`, the `java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException` is thrown to the client instead.]
footnote:a10244[If the `Remove` annotation specifies the value of `retainIfException` as `true`, and the `Remove` method throws an application exception, the instance is not removed (and the `PreDestroy` lifecycle callback interceptor methods are not invoked).]
footnote:a10245[If the business interface is a remote business interface that extends `java.rmi.Remote`, the `java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException` is thrown to the client instead.]
footnote:a10246[If a client calls lifecycle callback method through a business interface or a no-interface view, the method is treated like a business method.]
footnote:a10247[If the business interface is a remote business interface that extends `java.rmi.Remote`, the `java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException` is thrown to the client instead.]
footnote:a10248[If the business interface is a remote business interface that extends `java.rmi.Remote`, the `java.rmi.RemoteException` is thrown to the client instead.]
footnote:a10249[If an `AroundConstruct` lifecycle callback interceptor is associated with the stateless session bean, the container follows the rules for the `AroundConstruct` interceptors defined in the _Interceptors_ specification <<a9887>>.]
footnote:a10250[If a client calls lifecycle callback method through a business interface or a no-interface view, the method is treated like a business method.]
footnote:a10251[If an `AroundConstruct` lifecycle callback interceptor is associated with the singleton session bean, the container follows the rules for the `AroundConstruct` interceptors defined in the _Interceptors_ specification <<a9887>>.]
footnote:a10252[If a client calls lifecycle callback method through a business interface or a no-interface view, the method is treated like a business method.]
footnote:a10253[Note that the interfaces provided by the Bean Provider may have been generated by tools.]
footnote:a10254[Note that the EJB 2.x client view is not supported for singleton session beans.]
footnote:a10255[Except for singleton session beans.]
footnote:a10256[Note that this might result from the use of default interceptors, for example.]
footnote:a10257[It is also an error if the `Local` and/or `Remote` annotations are specified both on the bean class and on the referenced interface and the values differ.]
footnote:a10258[If `PrePassivate` or `PostActivate` lifecycle callbacks are defined for message-driven beans, they are ignored.]
footnote:a10259[If an `AroundConstruct` lifecycle callback interceptor is associated with the message-driven bean, the container follows the rules for the `AroundConstruct` interceptors defined in the _Interceptors_ specification <<a9887>>.]
footnote:a10260[This might result from the use of default interceptor classes, for example.]
footnote:a10261[This restriction may be removed in a future release of this specification.]
footnote:a10262[See <<a1254>>.]
footnote:a10263[Note that environment entries other than resources are specified with the `Resource` annotation and/or `resource-ref` deployment descriptor element as well.]
footnote:a10264[In this chapter we use the `TransactionAttribute` annotation values to refer to transaction attributes. The deployment descriptor may be used as an overriding mechanism or an alternative to the use of annotations.]
footnote:a10265[The use of the term "container" here encompasses both the container and the messaging provider. When the contracts outlined in <<a9863>> are used, it may be the messaging provider that starts the transaction.]
footnote:a10266[This restriction may be removed in a future release of this specification.]
footnote:a10267[However, use of the Java Persistence API `EntityTransaction` interface is supported. See <<a9851>> for a discussion of resources used in the Java Persistence API that may be "unaware" of the presence of JTA transactions, and a description of the `EntityTransaction` interface and its use.]
footnote:a10268[Note that the Bean Provider must use the pre-passivate callback method here to close the connections and set the instance variables for the connection to null.]
footnote:a10269[REQUIRED is the default transaction attribute value for container managed transaction demarcation. The explicit specification of the transaction attribute is therefore not required in this example.]
footnote:a10270[If a stateful session bean's `PostConstruct`, `PreDestroy`, `PrePassivate` or `PostActivate` lifecycle callback interceptor methods are invoked in the scope of a transaction, `SessionSynchronization` callbacks for such transactions are not called on the bean instance.]
footnote:a10271[However, use of the Java Persistence API `EntityTransaction` interface is supported. See <<a9851>> for a discussion of resources used in the Java Persistence API that may be "unaware" of the presence of JTA transactions, and a description of the `EntityTransaction` interface and its use.]
footnote:a10272[The container typically relies on a transaction manager that is part of the EJB server to perform the two-phase commit across all the enlisted resource managers. If only a single resource manager is involved in the transaction and the deployment descriptor indicates that connection sharing may be used, the container may use the local transaction optimization. See <<a9861>> and <<a9863>> for further discussion.]
footnote:a10273[Note that if the bean is a singleton session bean, the instance must not be discarded unless the exception occurred in an `AroundConstruct`, `PostConstruct` or `PreDestroy` lifecycle interceptor method.]

footnote:a10283[If a transaction had been marked for rollback, the value of the rollback element has no effect.]

footnote:a10317[One way to include the tagged components in IORs is to create the object references using a Portable Object Adapter (POA) which is initialized with the appropriate transaction policies. Note that POA APIs are not required to be supported by server containers.]
footnote:a10318[If the InvocationPolicy is not present in the IOR, it is interpreted by the client as if the policy value was `CosTransactions::EITHER`.]
footnote:a10319[When there are concurrent invocations on a component from multiple clients, a different principal may be associated with the thread of execution for each invocation.]
footnote:a10320[One way to achieve this is to configure a "trusted container list" for each Enterprise Beans Container which contains the list of intermediate client containers that are trusted. If the list is empty, then the target EJB container does not have a trust relationship with any intermediate container.]

footnote:a10333[This functionality may be added in a future release of this specification.]
footnote:a10334[In the event of race conditions, extraneous calls to the timeout callback method may occur.]
footnote:a10335[Note that annotation `java.lang.String` attributes use the empty string "" as a default, so the expression @Schedule(timezone="", ...) will result in a null value from the corresponding ScheduleExpression.getTimezone() method.]
footnote:a10336[Note that the default value of the `info` element of the `Schedule` annotation is the empty string "". The expression `@Schedule(info="", ...)` will also result in a null value from the timer’s `getInfo()` method.]
footnote:a10337[There is currently no way to set the information object after timer creation. An API to do this may be added in a future release of this specification.]
footnote:a10338[This method may be specified on the bean class or on a superclass. If the `Timeout` annotation is used or the bean implements the `TimedObject` interface, the `timeout-method` deployment descriptor element, if specified, can only be used to refer to the same method.]
footnote:a10339[If the bean implements the `TimedObject` interface, the `Timeout` annotation may optionally be applied to the `ejbTimeout` method.]
footnote:a10340[An earlier version of the specification required that timeout callbacks accept the `Timer` parameter but did not require that this parameter be listed when declared by means of the deployment descriptor. To preserve backward compatibility, a `timeout-method` that does not include a `method-param` element for the `javax.ejb.Timer` parameter may be used to match either a timeout method signature with or without a Timer parameter, if there is only one method with the specified name. If methods with the specified name are overloaded, a `timeout-method` element with an empty `method-params` element will be used to explicitly refer to a the no-arg timeout method.]
footnote:a10341[The concurrency-management-type Container may be specified for stateful session beans, but doing so has no impact on the semantics of concurrency management for such beans.]
footnote:a10342[This permission is necessary, for example, to allow enterprise beans to use the client functionality of the Java IDL and RMI-IIOP packages that are part of the Java 2 platform.]
