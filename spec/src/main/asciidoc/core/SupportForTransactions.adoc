== Support for Transactions

One of the key features of the Enterprise
JavaBeans(TM) architecture is support for distributed transactions. The
Enterprise JavaBeans architecture allows an application developer to
write an application that atomically updates data in multiple databases
which may be distributed across multiple sites. The sites may use EJB
servers from different vendors.

=== Overview

This section provides a brief overview of
transactions and illustrates a number of transaction scenarios in EJB.

==== Transactions

_Transactions are a proven technique for
simplifying application programming. Transactions free the application
programmer from dealing with the complex issues of failure recovery and
multi-user programming. The transactional system ensures that a unit of
work either fully completes, or the work is fully rolled back.
Furthermore, transactions make it possible for the programmer to design
the application as if it ran in an environment that executes units of
work serially._

Support for
transactions is an essential element of the Enterprise JavaBeans
architecture. The Enterprise Bean Provider and the client application
programmer are not exposed to the complexity of distributed
transactions. The Bean Provider can choose between using programmatic
transaction demarcation in the enterprise bean code (this style is
called _bean-managed transaction demarcation_) or declarative transaction
demarcation performed automatically by the EJB container (this style is
called _container-managed transaction demarcation_).

With bean-managed
transaction demarcation, the enterprise bean code demarcates
transactions using the `javax.transaction.UserTransaction` interface. All
resource manager accesses between the `UserTransaction.begin` and
`UserTransaction.commit` calls are part of a transaction.

{empty}::
_The terms resource and resource manager used
in this chapter refer to the resources declared using the `Resource`
annotation in the enterprise bean class or using the `resource-ref`
element in the enterprise bean’s deployment descriptor. This includes
not only database resources, but also other resources, such as JMS
Connections. These resources are considered to be "managed" by the
container.footnote:a10263[Note that environment entries other than 
resources are specified with the `Resource` annotation and/or 
`resource-ref` deployment descriptor element as well.] 
For a discussion about resources used
in the Java Persistence API that may be "unaware" of the presence of JTA
transactions, see <<a9851>>._

With
container-managed transaction demarcation, the container demarcates
transactions per instructions provided by the developer in metadata
annotations or in the deployment descriptor. These instructions, called
_transaction attributes_, tell the container whether it should include the
work performed by an enterprise bean method in a client’s transaction,
run the enterprise bean method in a new transaction started by the
container, or run the method with "no transaction" (Refer to <<a2889>> 
for the description of the "no transaction" case).

Regardless of whether an enterprise bean uses
bean-managed or container-managed
transaction demarcation, the burden of
implementing transaction management is on the EJB Container and Server
Provider. The EJB container and server implement the necessary low-level
transaction protocols, such as the two-phase commit protocol between a
transaction manager and a database system or messaging provider,
transaction context propagation, and distributed two-phase commit.

_Many applications will consist of one or
several enterprise beans that all use a single resource manager
(typically a relational database management system). The EJB container
can make use of resource manager local transactions as an optimization
technique for enterprise beans for which distributed transactions are
not needed. A resource manager local transaction does not involve
control or coordination by an external transaction manager. The
container’s use of local transactions as an optimization technique for
enterprise beans with either container-managed transaction demarcation
or bean-managed transaction demarcation is not visible to the enterprise
beans. For a discussion of the use of resource manager local
transactions as a container optimization strategy, refer to
<<a9861>> and <<a9863>>._

==== Transaction Model

The Enterprise
JavaBeans architecture supports flat transactions. A flat transaction
cannot have any child (nested) transactions.

{empty}::
_Note: The decision not to support nested
transactions allows vendors of existing transaction processing and
database management systems to incorporate support for Enterprise
JavaBeans. If these vendors provide support for nested transactions in
the future, Enterprise JavaBeans may be enhanced to take advantage of
nested transactions._

==== Relationship to JTA and JTS

The Java™ Transaction API (JTA) <<a9857>> is a specification of the
interfaces between a transaction manager and the other parties involved
in a distributed transaction processing system: the application
programs, the resource managers, and the application server.

The Java
Transaction Service (JTS) <<a9858>>
API is a Java binding of the CORBA Object Transaction Service (OTS) 1.1
specification. JTS provides transaction interoperability using the
standard IIOP protocol for transaction propagation between servers. The
JTS API is intended for vendors who implement transaction processing
infrastructure for enterprise middleware. For example, an EJB server
vendor may use a JTS implementation as the underlying transaction
manager.

The EJB architecture does not require the EJB
container to support the JTS interfaces. The EJB architecture requires
that the EJB container support the JTA API defined in <<a9857>> 
and the Connector APIs defined in <<a9863>>.

=== Sample Scenarios

_This section describes several scenarios that
illustrate the distributed transaction capabilities of the Enterprise
JavaBeans architecture._

==== Update of Multiple Databases

The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture makes
it possible for an application program to update data in multiple
databases in a single transaction.

_In the following figure, a client invokes the
enterprise bean X. Bean X updates data using two database connections
that the Deployer configured to connect with two different databases, A
and B. Then X calls another enterprise bean, Y. Bean Y updates data in
database C. The EJB server ensures that the updates to databases A, B,
and C are either all committed or all rolled back._

.Updates to Simultaneous Databases
image::EBCore-15.png[]

_The application programmer does not have to
do anything to ensure transactional semantics. Behind the scenes, the
EJB server enlists the database connections as part of the transaction.
When the transaction commits, the EJB server and the database systems
perform a two-phase commit protocol to ensure atomic updates across all
three databases._

==== Messages Sent or Received Over JMS Sessions and Update of Multiple Databases

The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture makes
it possible for an application program to send messages to or receive
messages from one or more JMS Destinations
and/or to update data in one or more databases in a single transaction.

_In the following figure, a client invokes the
enterprise bean X. Bean X sends a message to a JMS queue A and updates
data in a database B using connections that the Deployer configured to
connect with a JMS provider and a database. Then X calls another
enterprise bean, Y. Bean Y updates data in database C. The EJB server
ensures that the operations on A, B, and C are either all committed, or
all rolled back._

.Message Sent to JMS Queue and Updates to Multiple Databases
image::EBCore-16.png[]

_The application programmer does not have to
do anything to ensure transactional semantics. The enterprise beans X
and Y perform the message send and database updates using the standard
JMS and JDBC™ APIs. Behind the scenes, the EJB server enlists the
session on the connection to the JMS provider and the database
connections as part of the transaction. When the transaction commits,
the EJB server and the messaging and database systems perform a
two-phase commit protocol to ensure atomic updates across all the three
resources._

_In the following figure, a client sends a
message to the JMS queue A serviced by the message-driven bean X. Bean X
updates data using two database connections that the Deployer configured
to connect with two different databases, B and C. The EJB server ensures
that the dequeuing of the JMS message, its receipt by bean X, and the
updates to databases B and C are either all committed or all rolled
back._

.Message Sent to JMS Queue Serviced by Message-Driven Bean and Updates to Multiple Databases
image::EBCore-17.png[]

==== Update of Databases via Multiple EJB Servers

The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture allows
updates of data at multiple sites to be performed in a single
transaction.

_In the following figure, a client invokes the
enterprise bean X. Bean X updates data in database A, and then calls
another enterprise bean Y that is installed in a remote EJB server. Bean
Y updates data in database B. The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture
makes it possible to perform the updates to databases A and B in a
single transaction._

.Updates to Multiple Databases in Same Transaction
image::EBCore-18.png[]

_When X invokes Y, the two EJB servers
cooperate to propagate the transaction context from X to Y. This
transaction context propagation is transparent to the application-level
code._

_At transaction commit time, the two EJB
servers use a distributed two-phase commit protocol (if the capability
exists) to ensure the atomicity of the database updates._

==== Client-Managed Demarcation

A Java client can use the
`javax.transaction.UserTransaction` interface
to explicitly demarcate transaction boundaries. The client program
obtains the `javax.transaction.UserTransaction` interface through
dependency injection or lookup in the bean’s EJBContext or in the JNDI
name space.

A client program using
explicit transaction demarcation may
perform, via enterprise beans, atomic updates across multiple databases
residing at multiple EJB servers, as illustrated in the following
figure.

.Updates on Multiple Databases on Multiple Servers
image::EBCore-19.png[]

_The application programmer demarcates the
transaction with begin and commit calls. If the enterprise beans X and Y
are configured to use a client transaction (i.e., their methods have
transaction attributes that either require or support an existing
transaction context), the EJB server ensures that the updates to
databases A and B are made as part of the client’s transaction._

==== Container-Managed Demarcation

Whenever a client invokes a method on an
enterprise bean’s business interface, on the bean no-interface view, on
a home or component interface, or a message listener method, the
container interposes on the method invocation. The interposition allows
the container to control transaction
demarcation declaratively through the transaction attribute set by the
developer. (See <<a2538>> for a description of
transaction attributes.)

For example, if a session bean method is
configured with the `REQUIRED` transaction attribute, the container
behaves as follows: If the client request is not associated with a
transaction context, the container automatically initiates a transaction
whenever a client invokes an enterprise bean method that requires a
transaction context. If the client request contains a
transaction context, the container includes
the enterprise bean method in the client transaction.

_The following figure illustrates such a
scenario. A non-transactional client invokes the enterprise bean X, and
the invoked method has the `REQUIRED` footnote:a10264[In this chapter we 
use the `TransactionAttribute` annotation values to refer to transaction 
attributes. The deployment descriptor may be used as an overriding 
mechanism or an alternative to the use of annotations.] transaction
attribute. Because the invocation from the client does not include a
transaction context, the container starts a new transaction before
dispatching the method on X. Bean X’s work is performed in the context
of the transaction. When X calls other enterprise beans (Y in our
example), the work performed by the other enterprise beans is also
automatically included in the transaction (subject to the transaction
attribute of the other enterprise bean)._

.Update of Multiple Databases from Non-Transactional Client
image::EBCore-20.png[]

_The container automatically commits the
transaction at the time X returns a reply to the client._

If a message-driven bean’s message
listener method is configured with the `REQUIRED` transaction attribute,
the container automatically starts a new transaction before the delivery
of the message and, hence, before the invocation of the
method.footnote:a10265[The use of the term "container" here encompasses 
both the container and the messaging provider. When the contracts outlined 
in <<a9863>> are used, it may be the messaging provider that starts the 
transaction.]

{empty}::
_JMS requires that the transaction be started
before the dequeuing of the message. See <<a9862>>._

The container automatically enlists the
resource manager associated with the arriving message and all the
resource managers accessed by the message listener method with the
transaction.

_It is illegal to associate JTA transactional
interceptors (see link:Ejb.html#a9857[See Java™ Transaction API,
version 1.2 (JTA). http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=907.]) with
Enterprise JavaBeans.footnote:a10266[This restriction may be removed 
in a future release of this specification.]_

=== Bean Provider’s Responsibilities

This section describes the Bean Provider’s
view of transactions and defines the Bean Provider’s responsibilities.

==== Bean-Managed Versus Container-Managed Transaction Demarcation

When designing an
enterprise bean, the developer must decide whether the enterprise bean
will demarcate transactions programmatically in the business methods
(bean-managed transaction demarcation), or whether the transaction
demarcation is to be performed by the container based on the transaction
attributes specified in metadata annotations or in the deployment
descriptor (container-managed transaction demarcation). Typically
enterprise beans will be specified to have container-managed transaction
demarcation. This is the default if no transaction management type is
specified.

A session bean or
a message-driven bean can be designed with bean-managed transaction
demarcation or with container-managed transaction demarcation. (But it
cannot be both at the same time.)

An enterprise bean instance can access
resource managers in a transaction only in the enterprise bean’s methods
in which there is a transaction context available.

===== Non-Transactional Execution

Some enterprise beans may need to access
resource managers that do not support an external transaction
coordinator. The container cannot manage the transactions for such
enterprise beans in the same way that it can for the enterprise beans
that access resource managers that support an external transaction
coordinator.

If an enterprise bean needs to access a
resource manager that does not support an external transaction
coordinator, the Bean Provider should design the enterprise bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation and assign the `NOT_SUPPORTED`
transaction attribute to the bean class or to all the bean’s methods.
The EJB architecture does not specify the transactional semantics of the
enterprise bean methods. See <<a2889>>
for how the container implements this case.

==== Isolation Levels

Transactions not only make completion of a
unit of work atomic, but they also isolate the units of work from each
other, provided that the system allows concurrent execution of multiple
units of work.

The `isolation level` 
describes the degree to which the access to a resource manager by
a transaction is isolated from the access to the resource manager by
other concurrently executing transactions.

The following are guidelines for managing
isolation levels in enterprise beans.

* The API for managing an isolation level is
resource-manager-specific. (Therefore, the EJB architecture does not
define an API for managing isolation levels.)

* If an enterprise bean uses multiple resource
managers, the Bean Provider may specify the same or different isolation
level for each resource manager. This means, for example, that if an
enterprise bean accesses multiple resource managers in a transaction,
access to each resource manager may be associated with a different
isolation level.

* The Bean Provider must take care when setting
an isolation level. Most resource managers require that all accesses to
the resource manager within a transaction are done with the same
isolation level. An attempt to change the isolation level in the middle
of a transaction may cause undesirable behavior, such as an implicit
sync point (a commit of the changes done so far).

* For session beans and message-driven beans
with bean-managed transaction demarcation, the Bean Provider can specify
the desirable isolation level programmatically in the enterprise bean’s
methods, using the resource-manager specific API. For example, the Bean
Provider can use the `java.sql.Connection.setTransactionIsolation` method
to set the appropriate isolation level for database access.

* Additional care must be taken if multiple
enterprise beans access the same resource manager in the same
transaction. Conflicts in the requested isolation levels must be
avoided.

[[a2250]]
==== Enterprise Beans Using Bean-Managed Transaction Demarcation

This subsection describes the requirements
for the Bean Provider of an enterprise bean with bean-managed
transaction demarcation.

The enterprise
bean with bean-managed transaction demarcation must be a session bean or
a message-driven bean.

An instance that
starts a transaction must complete the transaction before it starts a
new transaction.

The Bean Provider uses the
`UserTransaction` interface to demarcate transactions. All updates to the
resource managers between 
the `UserTransaction.begin` and `UserTransaction.commit` 
methods are performed in a transaction. While an instance is in
a transaction, the instance must not attempt to use the resource-manager
specific transaction demarcation API (e.g. it must not invoke the commit
or rollback method on the java.sql.Connection interface or on the
`javax.jms.Session` interface).footnote:a10267[However, use of the Java 
Persistence API `EntityTransaction` interface is supported. See <<a9851>> 
for a discussion of resources used in the Java Persistence API that may be 
"unaware" of the presence of JTA transactions, and a description of the 
`EntityTransaction` interface and its use.]

A stateful session bean instance may, but is
not required to, commit a started transaction before a business method
returns. If a transaction has not been completed by the end of a
business method, the container retains the association between the
transaction and the instance across multiple client calls until the
instance eventually completes the transaction. A stateful session bean
instance must commit a transaction before `PostConstruct`, `PreDestroy`, 
`PrePassivate` or `PostActivate` lifecycle callback interceptor method
returns.

A stateless
session bean instance must commit a transaction before a business method
or timeout callback method returns.

A singleton session bean instance must commit
a transaction before a business method or timeout callback method or
`PostConstruct` or `PreDestroy` lifecycle callback interceptor method
returns.

A message-driven bean instance must commit a
transaction before a message listener method or timeout callback method
returns.

If `AroundInvoke` interceptor methods are
applied to the business method or `AroundTimeout` interceptor methods are
applied to the timeout callback method of a singleton or a stateless
session bean or a message-driven bean, the transaction must be completed
before the last `AroundInvoke` or `AroundTimeout` interceptor method
completes.

The following code segments illustrate a
business method that performs a transaction involving two database
connections.

It is possible for an enterprise bean to open
and close a database connection in each business method (rather than
hold the connection open until the end of transaction). The following
code segments illustrate a stateful session bean for which the client
executes the sequence of methods (`method1`, `method2`, `method2`,
`method2`, and `method3 ). In this scenario, all the database updates
done by the multiple invocations of `method2` are performed in the scope
of the same transaction, which is the transaction started in `method1`
and committed in `method3`.

===== getRollbackOnly and setRollbackOnly Methods

An enterprise bean with
bean-managed transaction demarcation must
not use the `getRollbackOnly` and `setRollbackOnly` methods of the
`EJBContext` interface.

An enterprise bean with bean-managed
transaction demarcation has no need to use these methods, because of the
following reasons:

* An enterprise bean with bean-managed
transaction demarcation can obtain the status of a transaction by using
the `getStatus` method of the `javax.transaction.UserTransaction` interface.

* An enterprise bean with bean-managed
transaction demarcation can rollback a transaction using the `rollback`
method of the `javax.transaction.UserTransaction` interface.

==== Enterprise Beans Using Container-Managed Transaction Demarcation

This subsection describes the requirements
for the Bean Provider of an enterprise bean using container-managed
transaction demarcation.

The enterprise
bean’s business methods, message listener methods, business method
interceptor methods, lifecycle callback interceptor methods, or timeout
callback methods must not use any resource-manager specific transaction
management methods that would interfere with the container’s demarcation
of transaction boundaries. For example, the enterprise bean methods must
not use the following methods of the `java.sql.Connection` interface:
`commit`, `setAutoCommit`, and `rollback`; or the following methods of the
`javax.jms.Session` interface: `commit` and `rollback`.

The enterprise bean’s business methods,
message listener methods, business method
interceptor methods, lifecycle callback interceptor methods, or timeout
callback methods must not attempt to obtain or use the
`javax.transaction.UserTransaction` interface.

The following code segments illustrate
a business method in an enterprise bean with container-managed
transaction demarcation. The business method updates two databases using
JDBC™ connections. The container provides transaction demarcation as
specified by the transaction attribute.footnote:a10269[REQUIRED is the 
default transaction attribute value for container managed transaction 
demarcation. The explicit specification of the transaction attribute is 
therefore not required in this example.]

===== javax.ejb.SessionSynchronization Interface

A stateful
session bean with container-managed transaction demarcation can
optionally implement the `javax.ejb.SessionSynchronization` interface or
use the session synchronization annotations. Their use is described in
<<a736>>.

===== javax.ejb.EJBContext.setRollbackOnly Method

An enterprise
bean with container-managed transaction demarcation can use the
`setRollbackOnly` method of its `EJBContext` object to mark the transaction
such that the transaction can never commit. Typically, an enterprise
bean marks a transaction for rollback to protect data integrity before
throwing an application exception, if the application exception class
has not been specified to automatically cause the container to rollback
the transaction.

_For example, an `AccountTransfer` bean which
debits one account and credits another account could mark a transaction
for rollback if it successfully performs the debit operation, but
encounters a failure during the credit operation._

===== javax.ejb.EJBContext.getRollbackOnly method

An enterprise
bean with container-managed transaction demarcation can use the
`getRollbackOnly` method of its `EJBContext` object to test if the current
transaction has been marked for rollback. The transaction might have
been marked for rollback by the enterprise bean itself, by other
enterprise beans, or by other components (outside of the EJB
specification scope) of the transaction processing infrastructure.

==== Use of JMS APIs in Transactions

The Bean Provider should not make use of the
JMS request/reply paradigm (sending of a JMS message, followed by the
synchronous receipt of a reply to that message) within a single
transaction. Because a
JMS message is typically not delivered to
its final destination until the transaction commits, the receipt of the
reply within the same transaction will not take place.

Because the container manages the
transactional enlistment of JMS sessions on behalf of a bean, the
parameters of the `createSession(boolean transacted, int acknowledgeMode)`, 
`createQueueSession(boolean transacted, int acknowledgeMode)` and 
`createTopicSession(boolean transacted, int acknowledgeMode)`
methods are ignored. It is recommended that the Bean
Provider specify that a session is transacted, but provide `0` for the
value of the acknowledgment mode.

The Bean Provider should not use the JMS
`acknowledge` method either within a transaction or within an
unspecified transaction context. Message acknowledgment in an
unspecified transaction context is handled by the container.
<<a2889>> describes some of the techniques that
the container can use for the implementation of a method invocation with
an unspecified transaction context.

==== Specification of a Bean’s Transaction Management Type

By default, a session bean or message-driven
bean has container managed transaction demarcation if the transaction
management type is not specified. The Bean Provider of a session bean or
a message-driven bean can use the `TransactionManagement` annotation to
declare whether the session bean or message-driven bean uses
bean-managed or container-managed transaction demarcation. The value of
the `TransactionManagement` annotation is either `CONTAINER` or `BEAN`.
The `TransactionManagement` annotation is applied to the enterprise bean
class.

Alternatively, the Bean Provider can use the
`transaction-type` deployment descriptor element to specify the bean’s
transaction management type. If the deployment descriptor is used, it is
only necessary to explicitly specify the bean’s transaction management
type if bean-managed transaction is used.

The transaction management type of a bean is
determined by the Bean Provider. The Application Assembler is not
permitted to use the deployment descriptor to override a bean’s
transaction management type regardless of whether it has been explicitly
specified or defaulted by the Bean Provider. (See <<a5804>> for information
about the deployment descriptor.)

[[a2538]]
==== Specification of the Transaction Attributes for a Bean’s Methods

The Bean Provider
of an enterprise bean with container-managed transaction demarcation may
specify the transaction attributes for the enterprise bean’s methods. By
default, the value of the transaction attribute for a method of a bean
with container-managed transaction demarcation is the _REQUIRED_
transaction attribute, and the transaction attribute does not need to be
explicitly specified in this case.

A transaction
attribute is a value associated with each of the following methods

* a method of a bean’s business interface

* a method exposed through the bean class no-interface view

* a message listener method of a message-driven bean

* a timeout callback method

* a stateless or singleton session bean’s web service endpoint method

* for beans written to the EJB 2.1 and earlier client view, 
a method of a session bean’s home or component interface

* a `PostConstruct` or `PreDestroy` lifecycle
callback interceptor method of a singleton session bean

* a `PostConstruct`, `PreDestroy`,
`PrePassivate` or `PostActivate` lifecycle callback interceptor method
of a stateful session bean

The transaction attribute specifies how the
container must manage transactions for a method when a client invokes
the method.

Transaction attributes are specified for the
following methods:

* For a session bean written to the EJB 3.x
client view API, the transaction attributes are specified for those
methods of the session bean class that correspond to the bean’s business
interface, the direct and indirect superinterfaces of the business
interface, methods exposed through the bean class no-interface view, and
for the timeout callback methods, if any.

* For a stateless session bean or singleton
session bean that provides a web service client view, the transaction
attributes are specified for the bean’s web service endpoint methods,
and for the timeout callback methods, if any.

* For a singleton session bean, the transaction
attributes are specified for the `PostConstruct` and `PreDestroy` lifecycle
callback interceptor methods, if any. In order to specify the
transaction attribute for a `PostConstuct` or `PreDestroy` method of a
singleton session bean, the transaction attribute must be specified for
the method(s) on the bean class, rather than for a superclass or
`PostConstruct` or `PreDestroy` interceptor method.

* For a stateful session bean, the transaction
attributes are specified for the `PostConstruct`, `PreDestroy`, `PrePassivate`
or `PostActivate` lifecycle callback interceptor methods, if any. In order
to specify the transaction attribute for a `PostConstruct`, `PreDestroy`,
`PrePassivate` or `PostActivate` method of a stateful session bean, the
transaction attribute must be specified for the method(s) on the bean
class, rather than for a superclass or `PostConstruct`, `PreDestroy`,
`PrePassivate` or `PostActivate` interceptor method.

* For a message-driven bean, the transaction
attributes are specified for the message listenermethods on the
message-driven bean class and for the timeout callback methods, if any.

* For a session bean written to the EJB 2.1 and
earlier client view, the transaction attributes are specified for the
methods of the component interface and all the direct and indirect
superinterfaces of the component interface, excluding the methods of the
`javax.ejb.EJBObject` or `javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject` interface; and for the
timeout callback methods, if any. Transaction attributes must not be
specified for the methods of a session bean’s home interface.

By default, if a `TransactionAttribute`
annotation is not specified for a method of an enterprise bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation, the value of the transaction
attribute for the method is defined to be `REQUIRED`. The rules for the
specification of transaction attributes are defined in <<a2583>>.

The Bean Provider may use the deployment
descriptor as an alternative to metadata annotations to specify the
transaction attributes or as a means to supplement or override metadata
annotations for transaction attributes. If a transaction attribute value
is not specified in the deployment descriptor, it is assumed that the
transaction attribute specified in annotations applies, or—in the case
that no annotation has been specified—that the value is `Required`.

The Application Assembler is permitted to
override the transaction attribute values using the bean’s deployment
descriptor. The Deployer is also permitted to override the transaction
attribute values at deployment time. Caution should be exercised when
overriding the transaction attributes of an application, as the
transactional structure of an application is typically intrinsic to the
semantics of the application.

Enterprise
JavaBeans defines the following values for the `TransactionAttribute`
metadata annotation:

* MANDATORY
* REQUIRED
* REQUIRES_NEW
* SUPPORTS
* NOT_SUPPORTED
* NEVER

The deployment descriptor values that
correspond to these annotation values are the following:

* Mandatory
* Required
* RequiresNew
* Supports
* NotSupported
* Never

_In this chapter, we use the
`TransactionAttribute` annotation values to refer to transaction
attributes. As noted, however, the deployment descriptor may be used._

Refer to <<a2755>> for the specification of how the value
of the transaction attribute affects the transaction management
performed by the container.

For a message-driven bean’s message listener
methods (or interface), only the `REQUIRED` and `NOT_SUPPORTED`
transaction attributes may be used.

For an enterprise bean’s timeout callback
methods, only the `REQUIRED`, `REQUIRES_NEW` and `NOT_SUPPORTED`
transaction attributes may be used.

For a session bean’s asynchronous business
methods, only the `REQUIRED`, `REQUIRES_NEW`, and `NOT_SUPPORTED` transaction
attributes may be used.

For a singleton session bean’s `PostConstruct`
and `PreDestroy` lifecycle callback interceptor methods, only the
`REQUIRED`, `REQUIRES_NEW`, and `NOT_SUPPORTED` transaction attributes
may be used.

For a stateful session bean’s `PostConstruct`,
`PreDestroy`, `PrePassivate` or `PostActivate` lifecycle callback interceptor
methods, only the `REQUIRES_NEW` and `NOT_SUPPORTED` transaction
attributes may be used.

If an enterprise bean implements the
`javax.ejb.SessionSynchronization` interface or uses any of the session
synchronization annotations, only the following values may be used for
the transaction attributes of the bean’s methods: `REQUIRED`,
`REQUIRES_NEW`, `MANDATORY`.footnote:a10270[If a stateful session bean's 
`PostConstruct`, `PreDestroy`, `PrePassivate` or `PostActivate` lifecycle 
callback interceptor methods are invoked in the scope of a transaction, 
`SessionSynchronization` callbacks for such transactions are not called 
on the bean instance.]

_The above restriction is necessary to ensure
that the enterprise bean is invoked only in a transaction. If the bean
were invoked without a transaction, the container would not be able to
send the transaction synchronization calls._

[[a2583]]
===== Specification of Transaction Attributes with Metadata Annotations

The following rules apply for the
specification of transaction attributes using Java language metadata
annotations.

The `TransactionAttribute` annotation is used
to specify a transaction attribute. The value of the transaction
attribute annotation is given by the enum `TransactionAttributeType`:
[source, java]
----
public enum TransactionAttributeType {
    MANDATORY,
    REQUIRED,
    REQUIRES_NEW,
    SUPPORTS,
    NOT_SUPPORTED,
    NEVER
}
----

The transaction attributes for the methods of
a bean class may be specified on the class, the business methods of the
class, or both.

Specifying the `TransactionAttribute`
annotation on the bean class means that it applies to all applicable
business interface methods of the class. If the transaction attribute
type is not specified, it is assumed to be `REQUIRED`. The absence of a
transaction attribute specification on the bean class is equivalent to
the specification of `TransactionAttribute(REQUIRED)` on the bean class.

A transaction attribute may be specified on a
method of the bean class to override the transaction attribute value
explicitly or implicitly specified on the bean class.

If the bean class has superclasses, the
following additional rules apply.

* A transaction attribute specified on a
superclass _S_ applies to the business methods defined by _S_. If a
class-level transaction attribute is not specified on _S_, it is
equivalent to specification of `TransactionAttribute(REQUIRED)` on _S_.

* A transaction attribute may be specified on a
business method _M_ defined by class _S_ to override for method _M_ the
transaction attribute value explicitly or implicitly specified on the
class _S_.

* If a method _M_ of class _S_ overrides a
business method defined by a superclass of _S_, the transaction
attribute of _M_ is determined by the above rules as applied to class
_S_.

Example:
[source, java]
----
@TransactionAttribute(SUPPORTS)
public class SomeClass {
    public void aMethod() {...}
    public void bMethod() {...}
    ...
}

@Stateless 
public class ABean extends SomeClass implements A {
    public void aMethod() {...}

    @TransactionAttribute(REQUIRES_NEW)
    public void cMethod() {...}
    ...
}

----

Assuming `aMethod`, `bMethod`, `cMethod`
are methods of interface `A`, their transaction attributes are
`REQUIRED`, `SUPPORTS`, and `REQUIRES_NEW` respectively.

===== Specification of Transaction Attributes in the Deployment Descriptor

The following rules apply for the
specification of transaction attributes in the deployment descriptor.
(See <<a5910>> for the complete syntax of the deployment descriptor.)

Note that even in the absence of the use of
annotations, it is not necessary to explicitly specify transaction
attributes for all of the methods listed in <<a2538>>. 
If a transaction attribute is not
specified for a method in an EJB deployment descriptor, the transaction
attribute defaults to `Required`.

If the deployment descriptor is used to
override annotations, and transaction attributes are not specified for
some methods, the values specified in annotations (whether explicit or
defaulted) will apply for those methods.

[[a2624]]
====== Use of the container-transaction element

The `container-transaction` element may be used
to define the transaction attributes for the following methods:

* business interface methods

* home interface methods

* component interface methods

* message-listener interface methods

* no-interface view methods

* web service endpoint methods

* singleton `PostConstruct` and `PreDestroy`
methods

* stateful session bean `PostConstruct`,
`PreDestroy`, `PrePassivate` or `PostActivate` methods (see limitations)

* timeout callback methods

Each `container-transaction` element consists
of a list of one or more method elements, and the trans-attribute
element. The `container-transaction` element specifies that all the listed
methods are assigned the specified transaction attribute value. It is
required that all the methods specified in a single
`container-transaction` element be methods of the same enterprise bean.

The `method`
element uses the `ejb-name`, `method-intf`, `method-name`, and `method-params`
elements to denote one or more methods.

The optional `method-intf` element can be
used to differentiate between methods with the same name and signature
that are multiply defined across the business, component, and home
interfaces, web service endpoint, no-interface view, singleton and
stateful session bean lifecycle callbacks, and/or timeout callbacks.
However, if the same method is a method of a local business interface,
local component interface, or no-interface view, the same transaction
attribute applies to the method for all of them. Likewise, if the same
method is a method of both a remote business interface and the remote
component interface, the same transaction attribute applies to the
method for both interfaces.

There are three legal styles of composing the
`method` element:

*Style 1:*
[source, xml, subs=+quotes]
----
<method>
    <ejb-name>__EJBNAME__</ejb-name>
    <method-name>__*__</method-name>
</method>
----

This style is used to specify a default value of the transaction
attribute for the following methods, if any, of the specified enterprise
bean for which there is no Style 2 or Style 3 element specified:

* All methods of the business, home, or component interface

* All no-interface view methods

* All message listener methods

* Web service endpoint methods

* Singleton `PostConstruct` and `PreDestroy` methods

* All timeout callback methods

There must be at most one
`container-transaction` element that uses the Style 1 `method` element for a
given enterprise bean, unless the `method-intf` element is used with this
style.

This style may be used for stateful session
bean lifecycle callback methods to specify their transaction attributes
if used with the `method-intf` element value `LifecycleCallback`.

*Style 2:*
[source, xml, subs=+quotes]
----
<method>
    <ejb-name>__EJBNAME__</ejb-name>
    <method-name>__METHOD__</method-name>
</method>
----

This style is used for referring to a specified method of a business,
home, or component interface method; no-interface view method; message
listener method; web service endpoint method; singleton `PostConstruct`
and `PreDestroy` methods; or timeout callback method of the specified
enterprise bean. If there are multiple methods with the same overloaded
name, this style refers to all the methods with the same name.

There must be at most one
container-transaction element that uses the Style 2 `method` element for a
given method name, unless the `method-intf` element is used with this
style. If there is also a container-transaction element that uses Style
1 element for the same bean, the value specified by the Style 2 element
takes precedence.

This style may be used to refer to stateful
session bean `PostConstruct`, `PreDestroy`, `PrePassivate` or `PostActivate`
methods to specify their transaction attributes if any of the following
is true:

* There is only one method with this name in
the specified enterprise bean

* All overloaded methods with this name in the
specified enterprise bean are lifecycle callback methods

* The `method-intf` element is specified and it
contains `LifecycleCallback` as the value

*Style 3:*
[source, xml, subs=+quotes]
----
<method>
    <ejb-name>__EJBNAME__</ejb-name>
    <method-name>__METHOD__</method-name>
    <method-params>
        <method-param>__PARAMETER_1__</method-param>
        ...
        <method-param>__PARAMETER_N__</method-param>
    </method-params>
</method>
----

This style is used to refer to a single method within a set of methods
with an overloaded name. If there is also a `container-transaction`
element that uses the Style 2 element for the method name, or the Style
1 element for the bean, the value specified by the Style 3 element takes
precedence.

The following is an example of the
specification of the transaction attributes in the deployment
descriptor. The `updatePhoneNumber` method of the `EmployeeRecord`
enterprise bean is assigned the transaction attribute `Mandatory`; all
other methods of the `EmployeeRecord` bean are assigned the attribute
`Required`. All the methods of the enterprise bean `AardvarkPayroll` are
assigned the attribute `RequiresNew`.
[source, xml]
----
<ejb-jar>
    ...
    <assembly-descriptor>
        ...
        <container-transaction>
            <method>
                <ejb-name>EmployeeRecord</ejb-name>
                <method-name>*</method-name>
            </method>
            <trans-attribute>Required</trans-attribute>
        </container-transaction>
        <container-transaction>
            <method>
                <ejb-name>EmployeeRecord</ejb-name>
                <method-name>updatePhoneNumber</method-name>
            </method>
            <trans-attribute>Mandatory</trans-attribute>
        </container-transaction>
        <container-transaction>
            <method>
                <ejb-name>AardvarkPayroll</ejb-name>
                <method-name>*</method-name>
            </method>
            <trans-attribute>RequiresNew</trans-attribute>
        </container-transaction>
    </assembly-descriptor>
</ejb-jar>

=== Application Assembler’s Responsibilities

This section describes the view and
responsibilities of the Application Assembler.

There is no
mechanism for an Application Assembler to affect enterprise beans with
bean-managed transaction demarcation. The Application Assembler must not
define transaction attributes for an enterprise bean with bean-managed
transaction demarcation.

The Application Assembler can use the
deployment descriptor transaction attribute mechanism described above to
override or change the transaction attributes for enterprise beans using
container-managed transaction demarcation.

{empty}::
_The Application Assembler should exercise
caution in the changing the transaction attributes, as the behavior
specified by the transaction attributes is typically an intrinsic part
of the semantics of an application._

=== Deployer’s Responsibilities

The Deployer is permitted to override or
change the values of transaction attributes at deployment time.

{empty}::
_The Deployer should exercise caution in the
changing the transaction attributes, as the behavior specified by the
transaction attributes is typically an intrinsic part of the semantics
of an application._

_Compatibility Note: For applications written to the EJB 2.1
specification (and earlier), the Deployer is responsible for ensuring
that the methods of the deployed enterprise beans with
container-managed transaction demarcation
have been assigned a transaction attribute if this has not be specified
in the deployment descriptor._

[[a2695]]
=== Container Provider Responsibilities

This section defines the responsibilities of
the Container Provider.

Every client method invocation on a session
bean via the bean’s business interface (and/or home and component
interface), no-interface view, web service endpoint, and every
invocation of a message listener method on a message-driven bean is
interposed by the container, and every connection to a resource manager
used by an enterprise bean is obtained via the container. This managed
execution environment allows the container to affect the enterprise
bean’s transaction management.

_This does not imply that the container must
interpose on every resource manager access performed by the enterprise
bean. Typically, the container interposes only on the resource manager
connection factory (e.g. a JDBC data source) JNDI look up by registering
the container-specific implementation of the resource manager connection
factory object. The resource manager connection factory object allows
the container to obtain the `javax.transaction.xa.XAResource` interface
as described in the JTA specification and pass it to the transaction
manager. After the set up is done, the enterprise bean communicates with
the resource manager without going through the container._

==== Bean-Managed Transaction Demarcation

This subsection defines the container’s
responsibilities for the transaction management of enterprise beans with
bean-managed transaction demarcation.

_Bean-managed transaction demarcation can be
used with session and message-driven beans._

The container
must manage client invocations to an enterprise bean instance with
bean-managed transaction demarcation as follows. When a client invokes a
business method via one of the enterprise bean’s client views, the
container suspends any transaction that may be associated with the
client request. If there is a transaction associated with the instance
(this would happen if a stateful session bean instance started the
transaction in some previous business method), the container associates
the method execution with this transaction. If there are interceptor
methods associated with the bean instances, these actions are taken
before the interceptor methods are invoked.

The container must make the
`javax.transaction.UserTransaction` interface available to the enterprise
bean’s business method, message listener method, interceptor method, or
timeout callback method via dependency injection into the enterprise
bean class or interceptor class, through lookup via the
`javax.ejb.EJBContext` interface, and in the JNDI naming context under
`java:comp/UserTransaction`. When an instance uses the
`javax.transaction.UserTransaction` interface to demarcate a transaction,
the container must enlist all the resource managers used by the instance
between the `begin` and `commit`—or `rollback`—methods with the
transaction.footnote:a10271[However, use of the Java Persistence API 
`EntityTransaction` interface is supported. See <<a9851>> for a 
discussion of resources used in the Java Persistence API that may be 
"unaware" of the presence of JTA transactions, and a description of 
the `EntityTransaction` interface and its use.]
When the instance attempts to commit
the transaction, the container is responsible for the global
coordination of the transaction commit.footnote:a10272[The container 
typically relies on a transaction manager that is part of the EJB server 
to perform the two-phase commit across all the enlisted resource managers. 
If only a single resource manager is involved in the transaction and the 
deployment descriptor indicates that connection sharing may be used, the 
container may use the local transaction optimization. See <<a9861>> and 
<<a9863>> for further discussion.]

In the case of a
_stateful_ session bean, it is possible that
the business method or interceptor method that started a transaction
completes without committing or rolling back the transaction. In such a
case, the container must retain the association between the transaction
and the instance across multiple client calls until the instance commits
or rolls back the transaction. When the client invokes the next business
method, the container must invoke the business method (and any
applicable interceptor methods for the bean) in this transaction
context.

If a _stateless_ or
_singleton_ session bean instance starts a transaction in a business
method or interceptor method, it must commit the transaction before the
business method (or all its interceptor methods) returns. The container
must detect the case in which a transaction was started, but not
completed, in the business method or interceptor method for the business
method, and handle it as follows:

* Log this as an application error to alert the System Administrator.

* Roll back the started transaction.

* If this a stateless session bean,
discard the bean instance.footnote:a10273[Note that if the bean is a 
singleton session bean, the instance must not be discarded unless the 
exception occurred in an `AroundConstruct`, `PostConstruct` or 
`PreDestroy` lifecycle interceptor method.]

* Throw the
`javax.ejb.EJBException`.footnote:a10274[If the business interface is a 
remote business interface that extends `java.rmi.Remote`, the 
`java.rmi.RemoteException` is thrown to the client instead.] 
If the EJB 2.1 client
view is used, the container should throw thejava.rmi.RemoteException if
the client is a remote client, and the `javax.ejb.EJBException` if the
client is a local client.

If a
message-driven bean instance starts a
transaction in a message listener method or interceptor method, it must
commit the transaction before the message listener method (or all its
interceptor methods) returns. The container must detect the case in
which a transaction was started, but not completed, in a message
listener method or interceptor method for the message listener method,
and handle it as follows:

* Log this as an application error to alert the System Administrator.

* Roll back the started transaction.

* Discard the instance of the message-driven bean.

If a session bean or message-driven bean
instance starts a transaction in a timeout callback method, it must
commit the transaction before the timeout callback method returns. The
container must detect the case in which a transaction was started, but
not completed, in a timeout callback method, and handle it as follows:

* Log this as an application error to alert the System Administrator.

* Roll back the started transaction.

* If this is a stateless session bean or
message-driven bean, discard the instance of the bean.

The actions performed by the container for an
instance with bean-managed transaction are summarized by the following
table. T1 is a transaction associated with a client request, T2 is a
transaction that is currently associated with the instance (i.e. a
transaction that was started but not completed by a previous business
method).

[cols=3, options=header]
.Container’s Actions for Methods of Beans with Bean-Managed Transaction
|===
| Client’s transaction
| Transaction currently associated with instance
| Transaction associated with the method
| none | none | none
| T1   | none | none
| none | T2   | T2
| T1   | T2   | T2
|===

The following items describe each entry in
the table:

* If the client request is not associated with
a transaction and the instance is not associated with a transaction, or
if the bean is a message-driven bean, the container invokes the instance
with an unspecified transaction context.

* If the client request is associated with a
transaction T1, and the instance is not associated with a transaction,
the container suspends the client’s transaction association and invokes
the method with an unspecified transaction context. The container
resumes the client’s transaction association (T1) when the method
(together with any associated interceptor methods) completes. This case
can never happen for a message-driven bean or for the invocation of a
web service endpoint method of a session bean.

* If the client request is not associated with
a transaction and the instance is already associated with a transaction
T2, the container invokes the instance with the transaction that is
associated with the instance (T2). This case can never happen for a
stateless session bean, singleton session bean, or a message-driven
bean: it can only happen for a stateful session bean.

* If the client is associated with a
transaction T1, and the instance is already associated with a
transaction T2, the container suspends the client’s transaction
association and invokes the method with the transaction context that is
associated with the instance (T2). The container resumes the client’s
transaction association (T1) when the method (together with any
associated interceptor methods) completes. This case can never happen
for a stateless session bean, singleton session bean, or a
message-driven bean: it can only happen for a stateful session bean.

The container must allow the enterprise bean
instance to serially perform several transactions in a method.

When an instance attempts to start a
transaction using the `begin` method of the
`javax.transaction.UserTransaction` interface while the instance has not
committed the previous transaction, the container must throw the
`javax.transaction.NotSupportedException` in the `begin` method.

The container must throw the
`java.lang.IllegalStateException` if an instance of a bean with
bean-managed transaction demarcation attempts to invoke the
`setRollbackOnly` or `getRollbackOnly` method of the `javax.ejb.EJBContext`
interface.

[[a2748]]
==== Container-Managed Transaction Demarcation for Session Beans

The container is responsible for providing
the transaction demarcation for the session beans declared with
container-managed transaction demarcation. For these enterprise beans,
the container must demarcate transactions as specified by the
transaction attribute values specified using metadata annotations in the
bean class or specified in the deployment descriptor.

[[a2750]]
===== Session Synchronization Callbacks

If a session bean class implements the
`javax.ejb.SessionSynchronization` interface or uses the session
synchronization annotations, the container must invoke the `afterBegin`,
`beforeCompletion`, and `afterCompletion` callbacks on the instance as part
of the transaction commit protocol. If a stateful session bean's
`PostConstruct`, `PreDestroy`, `PrePassivate` or `PostActivate` lifecycle
callback interceptor methods are invoked in the scope of a transaction,
session synchronization callbacks for such transactions are not called
on the bean instance.

The container
invokes the `afterBegin` method on an instance before it invokes the first
business method in a transaction.

The container invokes the `beforeCompletion`
method to give the enterprise bean instance the last chance to cause the
transaction to rollback. The instance may cause the transaction to roll
back by invoking the `EJBContext.setRollbackOnly` method.

The container invokes the
`afterCompletion(boolean committed)` method after the completion of the
transaction commit protocol to notify the enterprise bean instance of
the transaction outcome.

[[a2755]]
==== Container-Managed Transaction Demarcation for Business Methods

The following
subsections define the responsibilities of the container for managing
the invocation of an enterprise bean business method when the method is
invoked via the enterprise bean’s business interface (and/or home or
component interface), no-interface view, or web service endpoint. The
container’s responsibilities depend on the value of the transaction
attribute.

===== NOT_SUPPORTED

The container
invokes an enterprise bean method whose transaction attribute is set to
the `NOT_SUPPORTED` value with an unspecified transaction context.

If a client calls with a transaction context,
the container suspends the association of the transaction context with
the current thread before invoking the enterprise bean’s business
method. The container resumes the suspended association when the
business method has completed. The suspended transaction context of the
client is not passed to the resource managers or other enterprise bean
objects that are invoked from the business method.

If the business method invokes other
enterprise beans, the container passes no transaction context with the
invocation.

Refer to <<a2889>> for more details of how the container
can implement this case.

===== REQUIRED

The container
must invoke an enterprise bean method whose transaction attribute is set
to the `REQUIRED` value with a valid transaction context.

If a client invokes the enterprise bean’s
method while the client is associated with a transaction context, the
container invokes the enterprise bean’s method in the client’s
transaction context, unless the method is an asynchronous method. The
client’s transaction context does not propagate with an asynchronous
method invocation. The semantics of the `REQUIRED` transaction attribute
for an asynchronous method are the same as `REQUIRES_NEW`.

If the client invokes the enterprise bean’s
method while the client is not associated with a transaction context,
the container automatically starts a new transaction before delegating a
method call to the enterprise bean business method. The container
automatically enlists all the resource managers accessed by the business
method with the transaction. If the business method invokes other
enterprise beans, the container passes the transaction context with the
invocation. The container attempts to commit the transaction when the
business method has completed. The container performs the commit
protocol before the method result is sent to the client.

===== SUPPORTS

The container
invokes an enterprise bean method whose transaction attribute is set to
`SUPPORTS` as follows.

* If the client calls with a transaction
context, the container performs the same steps as described in the
`REQUIRED` case.

* If the client calls without a transaction
context, the container performs the same steps as described in the
`NOT_SUPPORTED` case.

_The `SUPPORTS` transaction attribute must be
used with caution. This is because of the different transactional
semantics provided by the two possible modes of execution. Only the
enterprise beans that will execute correctly in both modes should use
the `SUPPORTS` transaction attribute._

===== REQUIRES_NEW

The container
must invoke an enterprise bean method whose transaction attribute is set
to `REQUIRES_NEW` with a new transaction context.

If the client invokes the enterprise bean’s
method while the client is not associated with a transaction context,
the container automatically starts a new transaction before delegating a
method call to the enterprise bean business method. The container
automatically enlists all the resource managers accessed by the business
method with the transaction. If the business method invokes other
enterprise beans, the container passes the transaction context with the
invocation. The container attempts to commit the transaction when the
business method has completed. The container performs the commit
protocol before the method result is sent to the client.

If a client calls with a transaction context,
the container suspends the association of the transaction context with
the current thread before starting the new transaction and invoking the
business method. The container resumes the suspended transaction
association after the business method and the new transaction have been
completed.

===== MANDATORY

The container
must invoke an enterprise bean method whose transaction attribute is set
to `MANDATORY` in a client’s transaction context. The client is required
to call with a transaction context.

* If the client calls with a transaction
context, the container performs the same steps as described in the
`REQUIRED` case.

If the client calls without a transaction
context, the container throws the
`javax.ejb.EJBTransactionRequiredException`.footnote:a10275[If the business 
interface is a remote business interface that extends `java.rmi.Remote`, 
the `javax.transaction.TransactionRequiredException` is thrown to the 
client instead.] If
the EJB 2.1 client view is used, the container throws the
`javax.transaction.TransactionRequiredException` exception if the client
is a remote client, and the
`javax.ejb.TransactionRequiredLocalException` if the client is a local
client.

===== NEVER

The container
invokes an enterprise bean method whose transaction attribute is set to
`NEVER` without a transaction context defined by the EJB specification.
The client is required to call without a transaction context.

If the client calls with a transaction
context, the container throws the
`javax.ejb.EJBException`.footnote:a10276[If the business interface is a 
remote business interface that extends `java.rmi.Remote`, the 
`java.rmi.RemoteException` is thrown to the client instead.]
If the EJB 2.1 client
view is used, the container throws the java.rmi.RemoteException
exception if the client is a remote client, and the
`javax.ejb.EJBException` if the client is a local client.

If the client calls without a transaction
context, the container performs the same steps as described in the
`NOT_SUPPORTED` case.

===== Transaction Attribute Summary

The following table provides a summary of the
transaction context that the container passes to the business method and
resource managers used by the business method, as a function of the
transaction attribute and the client’s transaction context. T1 is a
transaction passed with the client request, while T2 is a transaction
initiated by the container.

If the enterprise bean’s business method
invokes other enterprise beans via their business interfaces or home and
component interfaces, the transaction indicated in the column
"Transaction associated with business method" will be passed as part of
the client context to the target enterprise bean.

See <<a2889>> for how the container handles the
"none" case in <<a2786>>.

===== Handling of setRollbackOnly Method

The container
must handle the `EJBContext.setRollbackOnly` method invoked from a
business method executing with the `REQUIRED`, `REQUIRES_NEW`, or `MANDATORY`
transaction attribute as follows:

* The container must ensure that the
transaction will never commit. Typically, the container instructs the
transaction manager to mark the transaction for rollback.

* If the container initiated the transaction
immediately before dispatching the business method to the instance (as
opposed to the transaction being inherited from the caller), the
container must note that the instance has invoked the `setRollbackOnly`
method. When the business method invocation completes, the container
must roll back rather than commit the transaction. If the business
method has returned normally or with an application exception, the
container must pass the method result or the application exception to
the client after the container performed the rollback.

* The container must throw the
`java.lang.IllegalStateException` if the `EJBContext.setRollbackOnly` method
is invoked from a business method executing with the `SUPPORTS`,
`NOT_SUPPORTED`, or `NEVER` transaction attribute.

===== Handling of getRollbackOnly Method

The container
must handle the `EJBContext.getRollbackOnly` method invoked from a
business method executing with the `REQUIRED`, `REQUIRES_NEW`, or
`MANDATORY` transaction attribute.

The container must throw the
`java.lang.IllegalStateException` if the `EJBContext.getRollbackOnly` method
is invoked from a business method executing with the `SUPPORTS`,
`NOT_SUPPORTED`, or `NEVER` transaction attribute.

===== Handling of getUserTransaction Method

If an instance of
an enterprise bean with container-managed transaction demarcation
attempts to invoke the `getUserTransaction` method of the `EJBContext`
interface, the container must throw the `java.lang.IllegalStateException`.

===== Timing of Return Value Marshalling with Regard to Transaction Boundaries

When demarcating a container-managed
transaction for a business method invocation through a remote view or
web service view, the container must complete the commit protocol before
marshalling the return value.

[[a2854]]
==== Container-Managed Transaction Demarcation for Message-Driven Beans

The container is responsible for providing
the transaction demarcation for the
message-driven beans that the Bean Provider
declared as with container-managed transaction demarcation. For these
enterprise beans, the container must demarcate transactions as specified
by annotations on the bean class or in the deployment descriptor. (See
<<a5804>> for more information about the deployment descriptor.)

[[a2858]]
==== Container-Managed Transaction Demarcation for Message Listener Methods

The following subsections define the
responsibilities of the container for managing the invocation of a
message-driven bean’s message listener method. The container’s
responsibilities depend on the value of the transaction attribute.

Only the `NOT_SUPPORTED` and `REQUIRED`
transaction attributes may be used for message-driven bean message
listener methods. The use of the other transaction attributes is not
meaningful for message-driven bean message listener methods because
there is no pre-existing client transaction context (`REQUIRES_NEW`,
`SUPPORTS`) and no client to handle exceptions (`MANDATORY`, `NEVER`).

===== NOT_SUPPORTED

The container invokes a message-driven bean
message listener method whose transaction
attribute is set to `NOT_SUPPORTED` with an unspecified transaction
context.

If the message listener method invokes other
enterprise beans, the container passes no transaction context with the
invocation.

===== REQUIRED

The container must invoke a message-driven
bean message listener method whose
transaction attribute is set to `REQUIRED`
with a valid transaction context. The resource managers accessed by the
message listener method within the transaction are enlisted with the
transaction. If the message listener method invokes other enterprise
beans, the container passes the transaction context with the invocation.
The container attempts to commit the transaction when the message
listener method has completed.

Messaging systems may differ in quality of
service with regard to reliability and transactionality of the dequeuing
of messages.

The requirement for JMS are as follows:

{empty}::
_A transaction must be started before the
dequeuing of the JMS message and, hence, before the invocation of the
message-driven bean’s `onMessage` method. The resource manager
associated with the arriving message is enlisted with the transaction as
well as all the resource managers accessed by the `onMessage` method
within the transaction. If the `onMessage` method invokes other
enterprise beans, the container passes the transaction context with the
invocation. The transaction is committed when the `onMessage` method has
completed. If the `onMessage` method does not successfully complete or
the transaction is rolled back, message redelivery semantics apply._

===== Handling of setRollbackOnly Method

The container must handle the
`EJBContext.setRollbackOnly` method invoked
from a message listener method executing with the `REQUIRED` transaction
attribute as follows:

* The container must ensure that the
transaction will never commit. Typically, the container instructs the
transaction manager to mark the transaction for rollback.

* The container must note that the instance has
invoked the `setRollbackOnly` method. When the method invocation
completes, the container must roll back rather than commit the
transaction.

The container must throw and log the
`java.lang.IllegalStateException` if the `EJBContext.setRollbackOnly` method
is invoked from a message listener method executing with the
`NotSupported` transaction attribute

===== Handling of getRollbackOnly Method

The container must handle the
`EJBContext.getRollbackOnly()` method invoked
from a message listener method executing with the `REQUIRED` transaction
attribute.

The container must throw and log the
`java.lang.IllegalStateException` if the `EJBContext.getRollbackOnly` method
is invoked from a message listener method executing with the
`NOT_SUPPORTED` transaction attribute.

===== Handling of getUserTransaction Method

If an instance of a message-driven bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation attempts to invoke the
`getUserTransaction` method of the `EJBContext`
interface, the container must throw and log the
`java.lang.IllegalStateException`.

==== Local Transaction Optimization

The container may use a
local transaction optimization for
enterprise beans whose metadata annotations or deployment descriptor
indicates that connections to a resource manager are shareable (see
<<a4245>>). The container
manages the use of the local transaction optimization transparently to
the application.

The container may use the optimization for
transactions initiated by the container for a bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation and for transactions initiated
by a bean with bean-managed transaction demarcation with the
`UserTransaction` interface. The container cannot apply the optimization
for transactions imported from a different container.

The use of local transaction optimization
approach is discussed in <<a9861>> and <<a9863>>.

[[a2889]]
==== Handling of Methods that Run with "an unspecified transaction context"

The term 
"an unspecified transaction context" is used in the EJB specification to
refer to the cases in which the EJB architecture does not fully define
the transaction semantics of an enterprise bean method execution.

This includes the following cases:

* The execution of a method of an enterprise
bean with container-managed transaction demarcation for which the value
of the transaction attribute is `NOT_SUPPORTED`, `NEVER`, or `SUPPORTS`.

* The execution of a `PostConstruct` or
`PreDestroy` callback method of a stateless session bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation.footnote:a10278[See <<a608>>.]

* The execution of a `PostConstruct` or
`PreDestroy` callback method of a message-driven bean with
container-managed transaction demarcation.footnote:a10279[See <<a1702>>.]

The EJB specification does not prescribe how
the container should manage the execution of a method with an
unspecified transaction context—the transaction semantics are left to
the container implementation. Some techniques for how the container may
choose to implement the execution of a method with an unspecified
transaction context are as follows (the list is not inclusive of all
possible strategies):

* The container may execute the method and
access the underlying resource managers without a transaction context.

* The container may treat each call of an
instance to a resource manager as a single transaction (e.g. the
container may set the auto-commit option on a JDBC connection).

* The container may merge multiple calls of an
instance to a resource manager into a single transaction.

* The container may merge multiple calls of an
instance to multiple resource managers into a single transaction.

* If an instance invokes methods on other
enterprise beans, and the invoked methods are also designated to run
with an unspecified transaction context, the container may merge the
resource manager calls from the multiple instances into a single
transaction.

* Any combination of the above.

Since the enterprise bean does not know which
technique the container implements, the enterprise bean must be written
conservatively not to rely on any particular container behavior.

A failure that occurs in the middle of the
execution of a method that runs with an unspecified transaction context
may leave the resource managers accessed from the method in an
unpredictable state. The EJB architecture does not define how the
application should recover the resource managers’ state after such a
failure.

=== Access from Multiple Clients in the Same Transaction Context

This section describes a more complex
distributed transaction scenario, and
specifies the container’s behavior required for this scenario.

==== Transaction "Diamond" Scenario with an Entity Object

An entity
object footnote:a10280[Component contract and client view of entity 
beans are described in the EJB Optional Features document <<a9890>>.] 
may be accessed by multiple clients in the
same transaction. For example, program A may start a transaction, call
program B and program C in the transaction context, and then commit the
transaction. If programs B and C access the same entity object, the
topology of the transaction creates a diamond.

.Transaction Diamond Scenario with Entity Object
image::EBCore-21.png[]

_An example (not realistic in practice) is a
client program that tries to perform two purchases at two different
stores within the same transaction. At each store, the program that is
processing the client’s purchase request debits the client’s bank
account._

It is difficult to implement an EJB server
that handles the case in which programs B and C access an entity object
through different network paths. This case is challenging because many
EJB servers implement the EJB container as a collection of multiple
processes, running on the same or multiple machines. Each client is
typically connected to a single process. If clients B and C connect to
different EJB container processes, and both B and C need to access the
same entity object in the same transaction, the issue is how the
container can make it possible for B and C to see a consistent state of
the entity object within the same transaction.footnote:a10281[This diamond 
problem applies only to the case when B and C are in the same transaction.]

The above example illustrates a simple
diamond. We use the term diamond to refer to
any distributed transaction scenario in
which an entity object is accessed in the same transaction through
multiple network paths.

Note that in the diamond scenario the clients
B and C access the entity object serially. Concurrent access to an
entity object in the same transaction context would be considered an
application programming error, and it would be handled in a
container-specific way.

_Note that the issue of handling diamonds is
not unique to the EJB architecture. This issue exists in all distributed
transaction processing systems._

The following subsections define the
responsibilities of the EJB Roles when handling distributed transaction
topologies that may lead to a diamond involving an entity object.

==== Container Provider’s Responsibilities

This subsection specifies the EJB container’s
responsibilities with respect to the diamond case involving an entity
object.footnote:a10280[]

The EJB specification requires that the
container provide support for local
diamonds. In a local diamond, components A, B, C, and D are deployed in
the same EJB container.

The EJB specification does not require an EJB
container to support distributed diamonds.
In a distributed diamond, a target entity object is accessed from
multiple clients in the same transaction through multiple network paths,
and the clients (programs B and C) are not enterprise beans deployed in
the same EJB container as the target entity object.

If the Container Provider chooses not to
support distributed diamonds, and if the container can detect that a
client invocation would lead to a diamond, the container should throw
the `javax.ejb.EJBException` (or `java.rmi.RemoteException` if the EJB 2.1
remote client view is used).

==== Bean Provider’s Responsibilities

This subsection specifies the Bean Provider’s
responsibilities with respect to the diamond case involving an entity
object.footnote:a10280[]

The diamond case is transparent to the Bean
Provider—the Bean Provider does not have to code the enterprise bean
differently for the bean to participate in a diamond. Any solution to
the diamond problem implemented by the container is transparent to the
bean and does not change the semantics of the bean.

==== Application Assembler and Deployer’s Responsibilities

This subsection specifies the Application
Assembler and Deployer’s responsibilities with respect to the diamond
case involving an entity object.footnote:a10280[]

The Application Assembler and Deployer should
be aware that distributed diamonds might
occur. In general, the Application Assembler should try to avoid
creating unnecessary distributed diamonds.

If a distributed diamond is necessary, the
Deployer should advise the container (using a container-specific API)
that an entity objects of the entity bean may be involved in distributed
diamond scenarios.

==== Transaction Diamonds involving Session Objects

While it is illegal for two clients to access
the same session object, it is possible for applications that use
session beans to encounter the diamond case. For example, program A
starts a transaction and then invokes two different session objects.

.Transaction Diamond Scenario with a Session Bean
image::EBCore-22.png[]

If the session bean instances cache the same
data item (e.g. the current balance of Account 100) across method
invocations in the same transaction, most likely the program is going to
produce incorrect results.

The problem may exist regardless of whether
the two session objects are the same or different session beans. The
problem may exist (and may be harder to discover) if there are
intermediate objects between the transaction initiator and the session
objects that cache the data.

There are no requirements for the Container
Provider because it is impossible for the container to detect this
problem.

The Bean Provider
and Application Assembler must avoid creating applications that would
result in inconsistent caching of data in the same transaction by
multiple session objects.
