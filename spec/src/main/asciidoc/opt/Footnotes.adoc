[.footnoteNumber]# 1.# [[a3365]]More literally,
references are passed by value in the JVM: an argument variable of
primitive type holds a value of that primitive type; an argument
variable of a reference type hold a reference to the object. See
link:Ejb.html#a3334[See The Java Virtual Machine
Specification.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 2.# [[a3366]]The _findByPrimaryKey_
method is mandatory for the remote home interface of all entity beans.

[.footnoteNumber]# 3.# [[a3367]]The _findByPrimaryKey_
method is mandatory for the local home interface of all Entity Beans.

[.footnoteNumber]# 4.# [[a3368]]At this point it must
appear to the application that the entity has been removed from the
persistent store. If the container employs an optimistic caching
strategy and defers the removal of the entity from the database (e.g.,
to the end of transaction), this must be invisible to the application.

[.footnoteNumber]# 5.# [[a3369]]The relation names and
the relationship role names are not used in the code provided by the
Bean Provider.

[.footnoteNumber]# 6.# [[a3370]]An entity bean has no
_ejbCreate_ _<METHOD>_ and _ejbPostCreate_ _<METHOD>_ methods if it does
not define any create methods in its home interface. Such an entity bean
does not allow its clients to create new EJB objects. The entity bean
restricts the clients to accessing entities that were created through
direct database inserts.

[.footnoteNumber]# 7.# [[a3371]]The above requirement
is to allow the creation of an entity bean with bean-managed persistence
by subclassing an entity bean with container-managed persistence.

[.footnoteNumber]# 8.# [[a3372]]Containers using
optimistic caching strategies, for example, may rollback the transaction
at a later point.

[.footnoteNumber]# 9.# [[a3373]]The ability to refresh
the state of a read-only bean and the intervals at which such refresh
occurs are vendor-specific.

[.footnoteNumber]# 10.# [[a3374]]For example, an
implementation might choose to ignore such updates or to disallow them.

[.footnoteNumber]# 11.# [[a3375]]The
_findByPrimaryKey_ method is mandatory for all entity beans.

[.footnoteNumber]# 12.# [[a3376]]It is consistent with
this specification to provide options for this refresh to be deferred or
avoided in the case of read-only beans.

[.footnoteNumber]# 13.# [[a3377]]If the entity bean
class does implement the component interface, care must be taken to
avoid passing of this as a method argument or result. This potential
error can be avoided by choosing not to implement the component
interface in the entity bean class.

[.footnoteNumber]# 14.# [[a3378]]Not currently used in
EJB QL; reserved for future use.

[.footnoteNumber]# 15.# [[a3379]]Use of ejb-names in
EJB QL is reserved for future use.

[.footnoteNumber]# 16.# [[a3380]]Refer to
link:Ejb.html#a3331[See Database Language SQL. ANSI X3.135-1992
or ISO/IEC 9075:1992.] for a more precise characterization of these
rules.

[.footnoteNumber]# 17.# [[a3381]]The use of the
reserved word OF is optional in this expression.

[.footnoteNumber]# 18.# [[a3382]]These functions are a
subset of the functions defined for JDBC 2.0 and later drivers, as
described in Appendix D of the JDBC specification
link:Ejb.html#a3335[See JDBC™ 4.1 API (JDBC specification).
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=221.].

[.footnoteNumber]# 19.# [[a3383]]Containers and
databases may not support the use of the optional, third argument of the
LOCATE function. Portable applications should therefore avoid use of
this argument.

[.footnoteNumber]# 20.# [[a3384]]It is legal to
specify DISTINCT with MAX or MIN, but it does not affect the result.

[.footnoteNumber]# 21.# [[a3385]]An entity Bean has no
_ejbCreate<METHOD>_ and _ejbPostCreate<METHOD>_ methods if it does not
define any create methods in its home interface. Such an entity bean
does not allow the clients to create new entity objects. The entity bean
restricts the clients to accessing entities that were created through
direct database inserts.

[.footnoteNumber]# 22.# [[a3386]]The EJB specification
does not require the distributed flushing of state. The container in
which the _ejbFind<METHOD>_ method executes is not required to propagate
the flush to a different container.

refresh the state of a read-only bean and the intervals at which such
refresh occurs are vendor-specific.]

[.footnoteNumber]# 24.# [[a3388]]For example, an
implementation might choose to ignore such updates or to disallow them.

[.footnoteNumber]# 25.# [[a3389]]This call may be
omitted if the bean has been specified as read-only.

[.footnoteNumber]# 26.# [[a3390]]This applies also to
the Never and Supports attribute.

[.footnoteNumber]# 27.# [[a3391]]This ejbStore call
may be omitted if the bean has been specified as read-only.

[.footnoteNumber]# 28.# [[a3392]]The finder will be
also compatible with Java 2-based containers and clients.

[.footnoteNumber]# 29.# [[a3393]]If the entity bean
class does implement the component interface, care must be taken to
avoid passing of this as a method argument or result. This potential
error can be avoided by choosing not to implement the component
interface in the entity bean class.

[.footnoteNumber]# 30.# [[a3394]]Note that the
deployment descriptor must be used to specify transaction attributes for
entity bean methods if the transaction attribute is not _Required_ (the
default value)

[.footnoteNumber]# 31.# [[a3395]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.RemoteException_ is thrown to the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 32.# [[a3396]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _javax.transaction.TransactionRolledbackException_ is thrown to
the client instead.

[.footnoteNumber]# 33.# [[a3397]]If the business
interface is a remote business interface that extends _java.rmi.Remote_
, the _java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException_ is thrown to the client instead.
